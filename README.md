# ShadowTokens

ShadowTokens is a cross-chain bridge between Elastos and Ethereum, enabling users to transfer digital asset ownership information (ETH, ELA, and any ERC20, ERC677, or ERC827 tokens) from one chain to the other quickly and reliably. The objective of this bridge is two fold:

1. Provide another scaling option for Ethereum via Elastos's EVM-comptabile sidechain (negligible fees, and secured by over 50% of Bitcoin's hashpower plus DPoS).
2. Enable Elastos to take full advantage of the tokens native to Ethereum, such as stablecoins for use in DeFi applications (TokSwap, Quicksilver).

ShadowTokens plans to develop more bridges in the future to provide interoperability for isolated blockchains. The smart contracts for this application use the multi-token extension for the Arbitrary Message Bridge, which has been audited and used for a variety of existing bridges (xDai, POA).

## Web Interface

This interface is intended to be a user-friendly tool to map assets between chains. A visual guide is provided here.
